 _you can use cdn, paste code to html, but you also can install bootstrap in ruby env, save cp+paste work._

###### Install bootstrap to rails 6
- [Add Bootstrap 4 to your Ruby on Rails 6 application](https://www.mashrurhossain.com/blog/rails6bootstrap4)
- (1) install boostrap by command:
```
  yarn add bootstrap@4.6.2 jquery popper.js
```
here use 4.x instead of 5.x because I want to use jumbotron in v4.x and 4.6.2 is the latest version of 4.x family.   
- (2) After installation, open package.json, confirm below is added.
```
  "bootstrap": "4.6.2",
  "jquery": "^3.6.4",
  "popper.js": "^1.16.1",
```
- (3) cp navbar code to application.html.erb file 
- (4) add config in app/assets/stylesheets/application.css, then reload homepage again, confirm navbar is activated.  
```
*= require bootstrap //new added
*= require_tree .
*= require_self
```
- (5) add js code to app/javascript/packs/application.js
```
import "bootstrap"
```
- (6) add below js code to config/webpack/environment.js
```
const webpack = require("webpack")

environment.plugins.append("Provide", new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
  $: 'jquery',
  jQuery: 'jquery',
  Popper: ['popper.js', 'default']
}))
```
- (7) Add container section into application.html.erb 
- (8) Use bootstrap color configuraion, create a new file: custom.css.scss under app/assets/stylesheets folder, import bootstrap and customize the style.  
```
@import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap';

.navbar {
  background-color: #FDF6EA !important;
  }
  
.navbar-brand {
  font-size: 3rem;
}  
  
h1 {
  color: darkblue;
}
```

###### Build up homepage
[background pages resource: unsplash site](https://unsplash.com/)

- add css code in custom.css.scss
- use bootstrap tag in home.html.erb
- add sticky-footer in home page.
  [refer here:](https://startbootstrap.com/snippets/sticky-footer-flexbox)
  - copy html code to html
  - copy css code to custom.css.scss

- Add links to logo, header etc.
 + in _navigation.html.erb
```
<a class="navbar-brand" id="logo" href="#">BETA BlOG</a>
```
change to 
```
<%= link_to "BETA BLOG", root_path, class: "navbar-brand", id: "logo" %>
```

- For bootstrap style use google search and add (omit, refer to source code)
- To disable the additional area which caused layout collapase, add below code to config/environment.rb
```
  ActionView::Base.field_error_proc = Proc.new do |html_tag, instance|
    html_tag.html_safe
  end
```
_But confirmed with current html code, no extra div generated by rails,but after add these codes, the layout looks right._
**Need to restart the server to enable this change.**  

- To style validation error message area, (1) create a new folder 'shared' and '_error.html.erb' as the common file for further usage, (2) move error message to _error.html.erb, (3) find alert code from bootstrap and style the code.

- clean up the layout: 
  + add footer in applicaiton.html.erb
  + remote <div class="page-content"></div> from home,index,show, edit, new files and add to applicaiton.html.erb
  ```
    <div id="page-content">
      <%= render 'layouts/messages' %>
      <%= yield %>
    </div>
  ```
  **Here, if change id="page-content" to class="page-content", the display is wierd, sticky-footer doesn't stick to bottom anymore, and bg color is not correct.**
